    <h1>My homeschooling journey</h1>
    <p>Up to year 5(10 years old), i went to eaton house the manor in clapham. in year 6 i left eaton house and became homeschooled
        along with my younger brother who was in year 3 at the time and at the start of 2019 we started having tutors come to our house 
        regularly. within two years we had both completed foundtation maths with grade 5 and the year after that i had done higher maths 
        and physics passing both with 8s(a*s). Soon after this i completed futher maths with a 7 and now am studying for another 4 gcses 
        and 2 A levels (maths and physics). Along with academic stuff, we had alot of extra curricula such as taekwon-do, cricket, tennis and 
        I am now a <a href="https://www.raf.mod.uk/aircadets/">air cadet</a> at  <a href="https://33f-squadron-battersea-royal-air-force-air-cadets.business.site/?m=true">33f battersea squadron</a>.
